This directory contains two subdirectories **c23** and **c62** containing files x5_23.m
and x5_62.m respectively. Simply loading the files in Magma by using load "x5_t.m", where
t is 23 or 62, verifies the claims in the sections $C_{23}$ and $C_{62}$ in the thesis. 

**Remark:** The value of the pairing for $C_{23}$ is $4/5$ instead of $1/5$ as mentioned
in the thesis. This is due to a mistake in multiplicatively inverting $d'$.
