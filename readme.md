This directory contains a few really scattered with lots of copies of similar codes. 
Most of the code is under constant development and there are things changing that might
give syntax errors.

*If you are a reviewer of my thesis and are looking for checking the examples in Chapter 4
and 5, then you would like to go the folders ExChap4 and ExChap5. Check the readme files
in the respective folders on how to run the programs. They are very different because of
different programs written in each case that were written at different times.*

**Caution! While trying to run
these programs please make sure to change the path of files being loaded in the start.**
